# Dissertation

This repository contains the report and deliverable for the final year project of my Computer Science degree. The goal of this project was to compare and contrast various modern real-time 3D rendering techniques, enabling the developers it is targeted towards to determine which technique best fits their use case.

The deliverable was used to compare various rendering techniques in varying scenarios, giving substance to the report itself. It contains the following features:

1. Implementations of various modern rendering techniques:
   * Forward rendering
   * Deferred rendering
   * Tiled-forward rendering
   * Tiled-deferred rendering
2. Runtime switching of rendering techniques
3. Performance data captures
4. Basic OBJ model loading
5. Runtime manipulation of the scene to set different scenarios
